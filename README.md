# Kyra's Dotfiles

So far, there's not going to be much here, but I'm just going to put what I
think I've done so far.

I've tried to keep this somewhat distro independent. Somethings have been
installed myself, such as [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) and
a [theme](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) for Rofi.
